- `data/trailheads.csv` (curated east/west/crest Sierra trailheads) and
  `scripts/assign_trailheads.py` to tag each peak with its nearest trailhead.
- Benchmark route data: `scripts/parse_benchmarks.py`,
  `data/benchmark_routes.csv`, and difficulty-progression charts.
- Interactive topo map (`scripts/map_clusters.py`) with OpenTopoMap /
  OpenStreetMap / Esri basemaps.
